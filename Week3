class Solution {
    public List<String> generateParenthesis(int n) {
        List<String> output_arr = new ArrayList();
        backtrack(output_arr,"",0,0,n);
        return output_arr;
    }
    
    public void backtrack(List<String> output_arr,String current_string,int open,int close, int max) {
        if(current_string.length() == max*2) {
            output_arr.add(current_string);
            return ;
        }
        
        if(open<max) backtrack(output_arr,current_string+"(",open+1,close,max);

The idea here is to only add '(' and ')' that we know will guarantee us a solution (instead of adding 1 too many close). Once we add a '(' we will then discard it and try a ')' which can only close a valid '('. Each of these steps are recursively called.

The goal is to print a string of “(“ ,”)” in certain order. The length of string is 2n. The constraints are that “(“s need to match “)”s.
Without constraints, we just simply print out “(“ or “)” until length hits n. So the base case will be length ==2 n, recursive case is print out “(“ and “)”. The code will look like

//base case
if(string length == 2*n) {
add(string);
return;
}
//recursive case
add a “(“
add a “)"

Let’s add in constraints now. We need to interpret the meanings of constraints. First, the first character should be “(“. Second, at each step, you can either print “(“ or “)”, but print “)” only when there are more “(“s than “)”s. Stop printing out “(“ when the number of “(“ s hit n. The first actually merges into the second condition.
The code will be:

//base case
if(string length == 2*n) {
add(string);
return;
}
//recursive case
if(number of “(“s < n){
add a “(“
}
if(number of “(“s > number of “)”s){
add a “)"
}
